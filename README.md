# RoPINN (NeurIPS 2024)

RoPINN: Region Optimized Physics-Informed Neural Networks. See [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14369) or [Slides](https://wuhaixu2016.github.io/pdf/NeurIPS2024_RoPINN.pdf).

This paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm of PINNs as **region optimization** and presents [RoPINN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14369) as a practical algorithm,  which can bring the following benefits:

- **Better generalization bound:** Introducing "region" can theoretically decrease generalization error and provide a general theoretical framework that first reveals the balance between generalization and optimization.
- **Efficient practical algorithm:** We present RoPINN with a trust region calibration strategy, which can effectively accomplish the region optimization and reduce the gradient estimation error caused by sampling.
- **Boost extensive backbones:** RoPINN consistently improves various PINN backbones (i.e. PINN, KAN and PINNsFormer) on a wide range of PDEs (19 different tasks) without extra gradient calculation.

## Point Optimization vs. Region Optimization

Unlike conventional point optimization, our proposed region optimization extends the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood region.

## Practical Algorithm

We present RoPINN for PINN training based on Monte Carlo sampling, which can effectively accomplish the region optimization without extra gradient calculation. A trust region calibration strategy is proposed to reduce the gradient estimation error caused by sampling for more trustworthy optimization.

## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.8 or Python 3.9 and **Pytorch 1.13.0**. For convenience, execute the following command.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```shell
bash scripts/1d_reaction_point.sh # canonical point optimization
bash scripts/1d_reaction_region.sh # RoPINN: region optimization
bash scripts/1d_wave_point.sh # canonical point optimization
bash scripts/1d_wave_region.sh # RoPINN: region optimization
bash scripts/convection_point.sh # canonical point optimization
bash scripts/convection_region.sh # RoPINN: region optimization
```
